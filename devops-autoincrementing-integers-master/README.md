### Location of deployed application
The application is containerized and can be run locally using Docker Compose. All services are accessible on localhost with the following endpoints:

- **Application**: https://localhost (HTTPS with self-signed certificate)
- **API**: https://localhost/api/v1/
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3001 (admin/admin)
- **Health Check**: https://localhost/health
- **Metrics**: https://localhost/metrics

**Repository URL**: https://github.com/abdullahsheik/thinkific.git


### Time spent
Approximately 4.5 hours, including:
- Containerization setup and configuration with production-ready Dockerfile
- HTTPS implementation with SSL certificates and proper HTTPâ†’HTTPS redirects
- Proxy layer configuration (Nginx with rate limiting and security headers)
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana) with metrics collection
- Logging infrastructure (Fluent-bit) configured for external log forwarding
- Database setup with PostgreSQL and Redis
- Comprehensive testing and validation
- Security hardening and environment variable configuration
- Production architecture documentation
- Multi-tenancy design and roll-out plan


### Assumptions made
1. **Development Environment**: Assumed Docker and Docker Compose are available on the target system
2. **SSL Certificates**: Used self-signed certificates for local development (in production, proper CA-signed certificates would be used)
3. **External Logging**: Configured Fluent-bit to forward logs to external endpoints as specified in requirements
4. **Monitoring**: Assumed Prometheus and Grafana are the preferred monitoring solutions
5. **Proxy Layer**: Chose Nginx as the proxy solution with rate limiting and security headers
6. **Multi-tenancy**: Designed for SaaS-style multi-tenant architecture with shared database approach
7. **Authentication**: Implemented API key-based authentication as the primary method
8. **Database**: Assumed PostgreSQL as the primary database with Redis for caching


### Shortcuts/Compromises made
1. **SSL Certificates**: Used self-signed certificates instead of proper CA-signed ones for local development
2. **Nginx Metrics**: Used basic nginx stub_status instead of nginx-prometheus-exporter for better Prometheus compatibility
3. **Rate Limiting**: Used Nginx's built-in rate limiting instead of more sophisticated solutions like Redis-based rate limiting
4. **Monitoring**: Basic Prometheus configuration without advanced alerting rules or custom dashboards
5. **Logging**: Simple log forwarding without log aggregation or advanced parsing
6. **Database**: Single PostgreSQL instance instead of read replicas or clustering
7. **Security**: Basic security measures without advanced WAF features or comprehensive security scanning
8. **Caching**: Basic Redis setup without advanced caching strategies or cache warming


### Stretch goals attempted
**Multi-tenancy Architecture**: Successfully designed a comprehensive multi-tenant SaaS architecture including:
- Database schema changes for tenant isolation (design complete, implementation pending)
- Application layer modifications for tenant context (design complete, implementation pending)
- Infrastructure considerations for multi-tenancy (documented, implementation pending)
- Detailed 8-week roll-out plan with risk mitigation (complete)
- Rollback procedures and success metrics (complete)

**Production Infrastructure**: Created detailed production architecture documentation including:
- Multi-AZ deployment strategy (documented, implementation pending)
- Auto-scaling configurations (documented, implementation pending)
- Security and compliance considerations (documented, implementation pending)
- Disaster recovery procedures (documented, implementation pending)
- Cost optimization strategies (documented, implementation pending)

**Security Hardening**: Implemented comprehensive security measures:
- Environment variable configuration for sensitive data
- Proper .gitignore to prevent credential exposure
- Non-root user in Docker containers
- Security headers and HTTPS enforcement
- Rate limiting and authentication

**What went well**: The multi-tenancy design was comprehensive and production-ready, with clear migration paths and risk mitigation strategies. The security configuration properly protects sensitive credentials.

**What could be improved**: Could have included more detailed Terraform/CloudFormation templates for infrastructure as code, and more sophisticated tenant isolation strategies like database-per-tenant or hybrid approaches.

   cd devops-autoincrementing-integers-master
   make setup
   ```
3. **Build**: Run `make build` to build all Docker images
4. **Start**: Run `make up` to start all services
5. **Wait for Services**: Allow 1-2 minutes for all services to become healthy
6. **Access**: 
   - Application: https://localhost (accept self-signed certificate)
   - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
   - Grafana: http://localhost:3001 (admin/admin)
   - Health Check: https://localhost/health
7. **API Testing**: 
   ```bash
   # Create a user
   curl -X POST https://localhost/users/create \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"username": "testuser", "password": "password123"}' \
     -k
   
   # Get integer value (use API key from user creation)
   curl -X GET https://localhost/api/v1/integer \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
     -k
   ```

### Your feedback on this technical challenge
This was an excellent technical challenge that effectively tested real-world DevOps skills. The requirements were well-balanced, covering both basic containerization and advanced concepts like monitoring, logging, and production architecture.

**Strengths of the challenge**:
- Comprehensive coverage of modern DevOps practices
- Real-world scenarios that mirror actual production requirements
- Flexibility in technology choices (nginx vs Kong vs HAProxy)
- Stretch goals that allow candidates to demonstrate advanced knowledge
- Clear requirements with room for interpretation and creativity
- Practical application of monitoring and observability concepts

**Suggestions for improvement**:
- Could include more specific performance requirements or benchmarks
- Might benefit from clearer guidance on the expected scope vs. stretch goals
- Could include more specific security requirements or compliance considerations
- Might benefit from sample data or load testing scenarios
- Could include more specific monitoring and alerting requirements

**What excited me most**: The opportunity to design a complete production architecture and the multi-tenancy stretch goal, as these are real challenges I've faced in production environments. The security aspects and proper credential management were also engaging.

**Time allocation**: The 4-6 hour estimate was reasonable, though I could have easily spent more time on advanced features like comprehensive alerting rules, load testing, and CI/CD automation. The time was well-spent on core functionality and security hardening.

**Learning outcomes**: This challenge reinforced the importance of proper credential management, comprehensive testing, and production-ready configurations. It also highlighted the value of good documentation and operational procedures.
