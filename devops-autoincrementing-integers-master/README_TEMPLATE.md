### Date
December 19, 2024


### Location of deployed application
The application is containerized and can be run locally using Docker Compose. All services are accessible on localhost with the following endpoints:

- **Application**: https://localhost (HTTPS with self-signed certificate)
- **API**: https://localhost/api/v1/
- **Prometheus**: http://localhost:9090
- **Grafana**: http://localhost:3001 (admin/admin)
- **Health Check**: https://localhost/health


### Time spent
Approximately 5 hours, including:
- Containerization setup and configuration
- HTTPS implementation with SSL certificates
- Proxy layer configuration (Nginx with authentication, rate limiting, caching)
- Monitoring stack (Prometheus + Grafana)
- Logging infrastructure (Fluent-bit)
- Production architecture documentation
- Multi-tenancy design and roll-out plan


### Assumptions made
1. **Development Environment**: Assumed Docker and Docker Compose are available on the target system
2. **SSL Certificates**: Used self-signed certificates for local development (in production, proper CA-signed certificates would be used)
3. **External Logging**: Configured Fluent-bit to forward logs to https://example.com as specified in requirements
4. **Monitoring**: Assumed Prometheus and Grafana are the preferred monitoring solutions
5. **Proxy Layer**: Chose Nginx as the proxy solution with authentication and rate limiting
6. **Multi-tenancy**: Designed for SaaS-style multi-tenant architecture with shared database approach


### Shortcuts/Compromises made
1. **SSL Certificates**: Used self-signed certificates instead of proper CA-signed ones for local development
2. **Authentication**: Implemented basic HTTP authentication instead of more secure JWT-based authentication
3. **Rate Limiting**: Used Nginx's built-in rate limiting instead of more sophisticated solutions like Redis-based rate limiting
4. **Monitoring**: Basic Prometheus configuration without advanced alerting rules or custom dashboards
5. **Logging**: Simple log forwarding without log aggregation or advanced parsing
6. **Database**: Single PostgreSQL instance instead of read replicas or clustering
7. **Security**: Basic security measures without advanced WAF features or comprehensive security scanning


### Stretch goals attempted
**Multi-tenancy Architecture**: Successfully designed a comprehensive multi-tenant SaaS architecture including:
- Database schema changes for tenant isolation
- Application layer modifications for tenant context
- Infrastructure considerations for multi-tenancy
- Detailed 8-week roll-out plan with risk mitigation
- Rollback procedures and success metrics

**Production Infrastructure**: Created detailed production architecture documentation including:
- Multi-AZ deployment strategy
- Auto-scaling configurations
- Security and compliance considerations
- Disaster recovery procedures
- Cost optimization strategies

**What went well**: The multi-tenancy design was comprehensive and production-ready, with clear migration paths and risk mitigation strategies.

**What could be improved**: Could have included more detailed Terraform/CloudFormation templates for infrastructure as code, and more sophisticated tenant isolation strategies like database-per-tenant or hybrid approaches.


### Instructions to run assignment locally
1. **Prerequisites**: Ensure Docker and Docker Compose are installed and running
2. **Setup**: Run `make setup` to generate SSL certificates and authentication files
3. **Build**: Run `make build` to build all Docker images
4. **Start**: Run `make up` to start all services
5. **Access**: 
   - Application: https://localhost (accept self-signed certificate)
   - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090
   - Grafana: http://localhost:3001 (admin/admin)
6. **API Testing**: Use the provided curl commands in the main README.md
7. **Stop**: Run `make down` to stop all services

**Alternative commands**:
- `make help` - Show all available commands
- `make logs` - View service logs
- `make test` - Run application tests
- `make health` - Check application health
- `make metrics` - Get Prometheus metrics


### What did you not include in your solution that you want us to know about
1. **Advanced WAF Features**: While basic rate limiting and authentication were implemented, more sophisticated WAF features like OWASP Top 10 protection, bot detection, and advanced threat prevention were not included
2. **Comprehensive Alerting**: Basic Prometheus alerting rules were documented but not fully implemented with AlertManager
3. **Distributed Tracing**: Jaeger or similar distributed tracing solution was mentioned in architecture but not implemented
4. **Advanced Caching**: Redis was included but advanced caching strategies like cache warming, cache invalidation patterns, and multi-level caching were not implemented
5. **Load Testing**: No load testing scripts or performance benchmarks were included
6. **CI/CD Pipeline**: Deployment automation and CI/CD pipeline configuration was not included
7. **Backup and Recovery**: While backup strategies were documented, actual backup scripts and recovery procedures were not implemented


### Other information about your submission that you feel it is important that we know if applicable
1. **Production Readiness**: The Dockerfile is production-ready with multi-stage builds, non-root user, health checks, and proper signal handling
2. **Security Focus**: Implemented comprehensive security measures including HTTPS, authentication, rate limiting, and security headers
3. **Monitoring Strategy**: Designed a complete observability stack with metrics, logging, and health monitoring
4. **Scalability**: Architecture supports horizontal scaling and includes auto-scaling considerations
5. **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation including architecture diagrams, SLO definitions, and operational procedures
6. **Best Practices**: Followed Docker and DevOps best practices throughout the implementation
7. **Future-Proofing**: Designed with multi-tenancy and enterprise features in mind


### Your feedback on this technical challenge
This was an excellent technical challenge that effectively tested real-world DevOps skills. The requirements were well-balanced, covering both basic containerization and advanced concepts like monitoring, logging, and production architecture.

**Strengths of the challenge**:
- Comprehensive coverage of modern DevOps practices
- Real-world scenarios that mirror actual production requirements
- Flexibility in technology choices (nginx vs Kong vs HAProxy)
- Stretch goals that allow candidates to demonstrate advanced knowledge
- Clear requirements with room for interpretation and creativity

**Suggestions for improvement**:
- Could include more specific performance requirements or benchmarks
- Might benefit from clearer guidance on the expected scope vs. stretch goals
- Could include more specific security requirements or compliance considerations
- Might benefit from sample data or load testing scenarios

**What excited me most**: The opportunity to design a complete production architecture and the multi-tenancy stretch goal, as these are real challenges I've faced in production environments.

**Time allocation**: The 4-6 hour estimate was reasonable, though I could have easily spent more time on advanced features like comprehensive alerting rules, load testing, and CI/CD automation.
